# NETBCI data

This repository comprises scripts designed for the preparation and processing of data for the Network Brain-Computer Interface Dataset (NETBCI). The dataset was collected at the  CENIR facility ([cenir-neuroimaging-platform](https://parisbraininstitute.org/cenir-neuroimaging-platform)), located at the Paris Brain Institute, France (CENIR Neuroimaging Platform). It will be made available in the near future through EBRAINS (www.ebrains.eu).

The repository includes scripts for anonymizing data and organizing it in accordance with the M/EEG-BIDS format. For detailed information regarding the NETBCI dataset, please refer to the forthcoming data descriptor.

Access to the NETBCI data will be provided at the following location, subject to the terms and conditions specified by EBRAINS (details to be announced).
